# Data Endeavor Template

## Overview
This is a general repo structure for "data endeavors" - tasks, initiatives, projects, or missions which revolve around data goals. This repo was originally developed by Microsoft as part of the [Team Data Science Process ProjectTemplate](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate) and has been modified.

## Process Recommendations
[Team Data Science Process (TDSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) is an agile, iterative, data science methodology to improve collaboration and team learning. It is supported through a lifecycle definition, standard project structure, artifact templates, and [tools](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-Utilities) for productive data science. 

**NOTE:** In some projects, e.g. short term proof of principle (PoC) or proof of value (PoV) engagements, it can be relatively time consuming to create and all the recommended documents and artifacts. In that case, at least the Charter and Exit Report should be created and delivered to the customer or client. As necessary, organizations may modify certain sections of the documents. But it is strongly recommended that the content of the documents be maintained, as they provide important information about the project and deliverables.
